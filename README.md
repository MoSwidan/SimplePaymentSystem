# Payment System in Dart

This repository demonstrates a simple payment system.

## How to Use

1. The `Payment` abstract class defines the contract for all payment methods.
2. The `CashPayment` and `CreditPayment` classes implement the `Payment` interface.
3. The `PaymentProcessor` class processes payments using the provided payment method.
